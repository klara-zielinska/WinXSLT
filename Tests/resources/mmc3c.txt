Suppl. Table 4. Mouse circRNA summary
chr,start,end,strand: coordinates in mm10 annotation
Annotation: NTO: intergenic; CTO: complete transcript overlap; AS: antisense; ITO: incomplete transcript overlap; ncRNA: non-coding RNA; INTRONIC: intronic; CDS,5UTR,3UTR: overlaps coding sequence, 5'UTR or 3'UTR; ANNOTATED: splice sites are annotated; ALT_DONOR, ALT_ACCEPTOR: not annotated splice donor or acceptor site
nExons: number of exons
length: predicted length
rawCounts: raw counts of backsplice-spanning reads in all samples in the same order as the preceding column names
allSHAM,allTAC: detected in all SHAM_mock or all TAC_mock with >=3 reads
rnoCircIndex, hsaCircIndex: index of rat,human homolog, if found
Normalized sample counts are given as backsplice-spanning reads per million uniquely aligned unspliced reads (RPM)
